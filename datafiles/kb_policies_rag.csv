If no authorization record is found, the failure is typically on the merchant or network side; the customer should be asked to retry with a different terminal or channel. Where a financial posting exists but the customer did not receive goods or services, a formal dispute must be raised in the card_disputes_chargebacks queue in line with scheme rules. For duplicate card charges or incorrect amounts, supporting evidence such as receipts, screenshots or merchant communication should be collected. The customer must receive a dispute reference number and clear timelines for temporary credit, investigation and final resolution."
KB_CARD_FRAUD_001,Unauthorized card transactions and card lost or stolen,"['credit_card', 'debit_card', 'prepaid_card']","['unauthorized_transaction', 'card_lost_stolen', 'card_blocked', 'international_usage_blocked', 'overseas_usage_issue']","['fraud_alert', 'card_transaction_dispute']",fraud_investigations,"If a customer reports unauthorized card transactions or confirms that a card is lost or stolen, the agent must immediately block the card and cancel any active digital wallet tokens. The customer’s recent activity should be reviewed to identify the disputed transactions and channels. A fraud case must be logged in the fraud_investigations queue with full transaction details, dates, and channels. Where network or scheme rules allow, provisional credit may be granted subject to investigation outcomes. The agent must clearly advise the customer not to share PINs, CVV, passwords or OTPs and arrange a replacement card. All actions should comply with regulatory reporting and internal suspicious activity escalation standards."
KB_FRAUD_MON_001,Handling proactive fraud monitoring alerts and customer confirmations,"['credit_card', 'debit_card', 'digital_wallet']","['unauthorized_transaction', 'card_declined', 'online_transaction_failure']","['fraud_alert', 'information_request']",fraud_monitoring,"Fraud monitoring systems may trigger alerts for unusual or high-risk card and wallet transactions. When the fraud_monitoring team contacts a customer, the agent must perform full identity verification before discussing any transaction details. If the customer confirms that transactions are legitimate, blocks may be removed in line with risk rules. If the customer denies transactions, the card must be blocked and a fraud case created for fraud_investigations. Documentation of customer responses, risk decisions and any changes to limits or channels must be captured in the monitoring system for audit and regulatory reporting."
KB_ATM_001,ATM cash not dispensed or ATM out of service with debited account,"['debit_card', 'current_account', 'savings_account', 'salary_account']","['atm_cash_not_dispensed', 'atm_out_of_service', 'withdrawal_issue']","['service_complaint', 'status_update_request']",atm_pos_operations,"For ATM complaints where cash was not dispensed or the ATM was out of service but the account was debited, the agent must confirm the ATM ID, date, time and amount. The atm_pos_operations team should check host and switch logs to determine whether the transaction was reversed automatically. If no reversal is visible within the standard SLA (commonly 24–48 hours), a formal ATM dispute must be registered and monitored. The customer must be provided with a complaint reference number and clear timelines for provisional and final credit. Any goodwill refunds or manual adjustments must follow delegated authority and be recorded in the core account notes."

The digital_banking_support team should confirm whether the profile is locked due to multiple failed attempts, whether credentials are expired, and whether the customer is using a supported app version and device. Password resets and biometric re-enrolment must follow secure procedures and never involve sharing full passwords or OTPs with staff. Repeated session timeouts or crashes should be logged with device type, OS version and timestamps and escalated to core_banking_it_support if systemic. Any incident affecting multiple customers must be flagged as a major incident according to ITIL processes."

The cybersecurity_and_access_management team should check for telecom outages, spam filtering, and any security blocks on the profile. Device binding or token activation may need to be reset following strong customer authentication. Security controls must not be bypassed simply to complete a transaction; any exception requires documented approval. All events that may indicate compromised contact details or devices must be escalated according to the bank’s security incident procedures."

The domestic_payments_operations team should verify the transaction status in payment gateways and core systems. If a payment failed before leaving the bank, any debited amount must be reversed within the published SLA. If the transaction reached the beneficiary bank but the customer claims non-receipt, interbank dispute procedures must be followed using the official reference (UTR or equivalent). Standing orders, employer mandates and direct debits should be checked for correct setup, expiry and sufficient funds. Customers must be given realistic timelines for resolution and guidance on how to avoid repeat failures."
KB_PAYMENTS_INTL_001,International transfer delays and overseas account usage issues,"['current_account', 'savings_account', 'salary_account']","['international_transfer_issue', 'overseas_usage_issue', 'international_usage_blocked']","['service_complaint', 'status_update_request', 'information_request']",international_payments_operations,"When customers complain about delayed or failed international transfers, the agent must obtain the transfer reference, currency, destination country and expected beneficiary. The international_payments_operations team should review SWIFT or equivalent messages, compliance holds and correspondent bank statuses.

The retail_account_operations team should confirm that regulatory retention and KYC requirements are met before closure. Any residual credit balance must be refunded via approved methods, and confirmation of closure should be provided to the customer.

The retail_account_operations team should recalculate interest where needed and confirm whether fees were triggered by valid events such as low balances or overdraft utilization. Where the bank is at fault or as a one-time goodwill gesture, refunds may be processed within delegated limits. Repeat complaints or systemic misunderstandings about fees should be escalated to the complaints_and_escalations_office for review of product design and customer communication."
